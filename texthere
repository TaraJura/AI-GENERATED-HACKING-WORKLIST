WHY RUBY NAME ? 

The name Ruby for the language got originated in an online chat session between Matsumoto and Keiju Ishitsuka on February 24, 1993
before even any code was written in the language. Initially two names were suggested ie Coral or Ruby.
The name Ruby was later chosen by Matsumoto in an email to Ishitsuka.

proč nil a ne null ?

Well, "nil" is the traditional name for the reified concept of "nothing" in Lisp and Smalltalk†. The word "null" is used as an adjective meaning "empty",
as in "the null list," which is nil. Meanwhile, "null" is traditionally a pointer value in C that signifies the pointer doesn't point to anything valid
